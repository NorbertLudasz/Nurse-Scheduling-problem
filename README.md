# Nurse-Scheduling-problem
A solution to the nurse scheduling problem written in Python using simulated annealing and artificial bee colony

Given n number of nurses over x days, as well as multiple hard restrictions (events that must not occur) and soft restrictions (events that should be prevented if possible), I created the best possible schedule for the hospital, considering multiple possibilities depending on which algorithm I used, and going forward with the best one.
